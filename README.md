# Sell Your Own X

🧲 **The Developer's Guide to Learning Marketing by Doing**

A curated collection of hands-on tutorials, step-by-step projects, and real examples that teach you marketing by building and shipping it yourself — with the same philosophy as "Build Your Own X", but focused on customer acquisition, growth, and storytelling.
