                    Hi {{first_name}},

                    Welcome to DevTool Pro! As a solo developer, I know your time is precious.

                    Here's what I recommend you do first:

                    1. **Install our CLI tool** (2 minutes)
                       curl -L https://devtool.pro/install | bash

                    2. **Connect your first project** (5 minutes)
                       Run: devtool init in your project directory

                    3. **Try the automated testing** (immediate results)
                       Run: devtool test --auto

                    You'll save 2+ hours this week alone.

                    Hi {{first_name}},

                    I noticed you've been using our testing features. Here's how to get 10x more value:

                    **Advanced Testing Techniques:**

                    1. **Smart Test Generation**
                       devtool test --generate
                       Auto-creates tests based on your code patterns

                    2. **Performance Testing**
                       devtool test --performance
                       Catches slow code before it hits production

                    3. **Visual Regression Testing**
                       devtool test --visual
                       Perfect for frontend changes

                    **Pro Tip:** Set up pre-commit hooks to run tests automatically:
                    devtool hooks --install

                    This alone saves our users 3+ hours per week.

                    P.S. Want to see these features in action? Here's a 3-minute demo:
                    https://devtool.pro/testing-demo
                `

                content: `
                    Hi {{first_name}},

                    Saw you're using our deployment features - smart choice!

                    Here's how to achieve zero-downtime deployments:

                    **The DevTool Pro Deployment Strategy:**

                    1. **Blue-Green Deployments**
                       devtool deploy --strategy=blue-green
                       Zero downtime, instant rollback capability

                    2. **Automated Health Checks**
                       devtool deploy --health-check=true
                       Automatically verifies deployment success

                    3. **Rollback in Seconds**
                       devtool rollback --version=previous
                       One command to undo any deployment

                    **Real Example:**
                    Sarah's team at TechCorp reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 8 minutes 
                    and eliminated all downtime incidents.
