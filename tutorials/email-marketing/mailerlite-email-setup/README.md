## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: MailerLite Account Setup

1.  **Sign up for a MailerLite account:** Go to [MailerLite.com](https://www.mailerlite.com/) and create a free account.
2.  **Verify your domain:** Follow MailerLite's instructions to verify your sending domain. This is crucial for deliverability.

### Step 2: Create Your First Signup Form

1.  **Navigate to Forms:** In your MailerLite dashboard, go to `Forms` -> `Embedded forms`.
2.  **Create a new form:** Give it a name (e.g., "Website Signup Form").
3.  **Design your form:** Use the drag-and-drop editor to customize the fields, text, and styling. Keep it simple for higher conversion.
4.  **Get the embed code:** After saving, MailerLite will provide a JavaScript snippet or HTML code. Copy this code.
5.  **Embed on your website:** Paste the code into your website's HTML where you want the form to appear.

```html
<!-- Example of embedding MailerLite form code -->
<div class="ml-form-embed" data-id="YOUR_FORM_ID">
  <!-- Form will be loaded here by MailerLite JS -->
</div>
<script>(function(m,a,i,l,e,r){ m['MailerLiteObject']=e;function f(){ var o={ a:arguments,q:[]};return r.push(o),o}e.c=f;e.get=f;e.push=f;e.skip=f;e.track=f; var g=a.createElement(i);g.async=1;g.src=l; var h=a.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];h.parentNode.insertBefore(g,h);})(window,document,'script','https://static.mailerlite.com/js/universal.js','ml');</script>
```

### Step 3: Organize Subscribers with Groups

Groups help you segment your audience and send targeted emails.

1.  **Create a new group:** Go to `Subscribers` -> `Groups` -> `Create group` (e.g., "Website Subscribers").
2.  **Connect your form to the group:** When creating or editing your signup form, ensure new subscribers are added to this group.

### Step 4: Send Your First Email Campaign

1.  **Navigate to Campaigns:** In your MailerLite dashboard, go to `Campaigns` -> `Create campaign`.
2.  **Choose campaign type:** Select "Regular campaign."
3.  **Design your email:** Use the drag-and-drop editor to create your email content. Add text, images, and buttons.
4.  **Select recipients:** Choose the group you created (e.g., "Website Subscribers").
5.  **Review and Send:** Check your email for errors and send it out!

### Step 5: Set Up a Simple Automation Workflow

Automations allow you to send a series of emails based on a trigger (e.g., a new subscriber joins a group).

1.  **Navigate to Automations:** Go to `Automations` -> `Create new automation`.
2.  **Define the trigger:** Select "When a subscriber joins a group" and choose your "Website Subscribers" group.
3.  **Add the first email:** Drag and drop the "Email" block. Design your welcome email (e.g., "Welcome to the Community!").
4.  **Add a delay:** Drag and drop the "Delay" block (e.g., 1 day).
5.  **Add a second email (optional):** Drag and drop another "Email" block for a follow-up message.
6.  **Activate the automation:** Turn on your automation workflow.
