## Title: How I Got My First 100 SaaS Users Without Paid Ads

**Content Pillar:** Educational

**Hook:**
After 3 failed startup attempts, I finally figured out community-driven growth. Here's the exact method that got me to 100 users in 6 weeks:

**Body:**
**The Problem:** Most founders start with paid ads or cold outreach. Both are expensive and don't build genuine relationships.

**The Method:**
1. Identify 5 communities where your target users hang out
2. Spend 2 weeks just lurking and understanding the culture
3. Start helping people with genuine advice (no product mentions)
4. Share your journey transparently (wins and failures)
5. Only mention your product when directly relevant to helping someone

**My Results:**
- Week 1-2: 0 users (just relationship building)
- Week 3-4: 23 users from helpful comments
- Week 5-6: 77 additional users from transparent sharing

**Key Takeaways:**
- Community acquisition takes time but builds trust.
- Value-first approach is crucial.
- Transparency resonates with audiences.

**Call to Action/Engagement Question:**
What's worked for your community growth? Any strategies I missed?
