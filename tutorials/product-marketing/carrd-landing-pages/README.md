**4. Call-to-Action (CTA):**
- A prominent button that tells visitors what to do next. (e.g., "Get Started Free," "Join the Waitlist.")
- Link this to a form, another page, or an email address.

**5. Features/Benefits (Optional):**
- Use icons and short descriptions to highlight 3-5 key benefits.

**6. Social Proof (Optional):**
