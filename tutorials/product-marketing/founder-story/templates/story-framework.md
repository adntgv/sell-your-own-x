## The Challenge-Change-Choice Framework

### 1. The Challenge (What problem did you face?)

- What frustration led you to start this company?
- What existing solution disappointed you?
- What moment made you think "there has to be a better way"?
- What personal or professional pain point drove you?

### 2. The Change (What did you discover or learn?)

- What insight or realization changed your perspective?
- What did you learn that others hadn't figured out yet?
- What unique approach or solution did you discover?
- What made you believe you could solve this differently?

### 3. The Choice (Why did you choose to build this solution?)

- Why did you decide to build a solution instead of accepting the status quo?
- What personal mission or vision drives you?
- Why are you uniquely positioned to solve this problem?
- What change do you want to see in the world?
