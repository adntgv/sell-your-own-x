# Founder Story Framework Template

Use this template to craft your authentic founder story using the Challenge-Change-Choice framework.

## Part 1: The Challenge
*What problem or frustration led you to start this company?*

### Reflection Questions:
- [ ] What was the specific moment or situation that frustrated you?
- [ ] What existing solutions disappointed you or fell short?
- [ ] What personal or professional pain point kept recurring?
- [ ] How did this problem affect you or others around you?

### Your Challenge Story:
```
Write 2-3 sentences about the specific problem you faced:

Example: "As a senior developer at three different startups, I was 
spending 4+ hours every day on repetitive tasks - manual testing, 
deployment scripts, code reviews for simple changes. I watched 
talented developers burn out from tedious work instead of building 
amazing products."

```

### Quantify the Impact:
- Time wasted: _____ hours per week/month
- Money lost: $_____ per month/year
- Opportunity cost: What could you have built instead?
- Emotional cost: How did this make you feel?

## Part 2: The Change
*What insight or realization changed your perspective?*

### Reflection Questions:
- [ ] What did you discover that others hadn't figured out yet?
- [ ] What unique approach or solution did you envision?
- [ ] What made you believe this problem was solvable?
- [ ] What technology, method, or insight was the key?

### Your Change Story:
```
Write 2-3 sentences about your key insight or realization:

Example: "I realized that 80% of development overhead could be 
automated with smart tooling that understands context. Not just 
scripts, but AI-powered tools that learn from your codebase and 
team patterns. The technology finally existed to build this, but 
nobody was doing it right."

Your version:
[Write your insight here]
```

### What Made You Unique:
- Unique perspective: What background/experience gave you this insight?
- Technical advantage: What skills or knowledge did you have?
- Market timing: Why was now the right time to solve this?
- Unfair advantage: What did you know that others didn't?

## Part 3: The Choice
*Why did you choose to build this solution?*

### Reflection Questions:
- [ ] Why build a solution instead of accepting the status quo?
- [ ] What personal mission or vision drives you?
- [ ] Why are you uniquely positioned to solve this problem?
- [ ] What change do you want to see in the world?

### Your Choice Story:
```
Write 2-3 sentences about why you chose to build this solution:

Example: "I chose to build DevTool Pro because I believe developers 
should spend their time creating, not configuring. Every hour saved 
on repetitive tasks is an hour that could be spent on innovation, 
learning, or even life outside of code. I've lived this frustration 
for 8 years - I know exactly what developers need."
